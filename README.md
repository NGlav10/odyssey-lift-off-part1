This is the companion app of the Apollo Graph Developer - Associate Certification! You can [find the course lessons and instructions](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/certifications/apollo-graph-associate), Apollo's learning platform.

## Getting Started

1. Run the setup script to install dependencies in `client/` & `server/`

```
bin/setup
```

2. Start the GraphQL API server.

```
bin/start_server
```

3. In another terminal window, start the React app

```
bin/start_client

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
